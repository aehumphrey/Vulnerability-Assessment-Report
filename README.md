# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Objective

The goal of the Vulnerability Assessment Report project is comprehensively identify and evaluate potential security weaknesses within an organization.By conducting a systematic analysis of network configurations, software systems, and operational practices, the assessment aims to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of relevant regulatory requirements and standards related to cybersecurity.
- Proficient in identifying root causes of vulnerabilities and proposing effective mitigation strategies.
- Ability to analyze complex systems to anticipate potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
- Knowledge of vulnerabilities, their potential exploits, and recommended fixes.
- Ability to clearly articulate findings and recommendations to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Project: Vulnerability Assessment Report

### System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose
The database server is a centralized system. The server stores data, including customer, campaign, and analytic data, which is later analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing campaigns. Due to the large amounts of data handled by this server, it is critical that security is prioritized. In the event that this server were disabled, marketing operations would be severely impacted.

### Risk Assessment

| Threat Source   | Threat Event   | Likelihood   | Severity   | Risk   |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Hacker  | Obtain sensitive information  | 3   | 3   | 9   |
| Employee  | Disrupt operations | 2   | 3   | 6   |
| Customer  | Alter/delete information  | 1   | 3   | 3   |

### Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.

### Remediation Strategy

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
